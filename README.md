# Dissertation Project: Embedded Parallel Computing Toolkit

For information on what this project does and how it works, check out the [paper](https://github.com/nebrius/dissertation_paper).

It's not really possible to run this code, unfortuntely. It was written using Code Composer Studio circa 2010 (version 3 I think) for a specific, custom designed hardware platform. The code was designed to run on a network of [Texas Instruments F2808](http://www.ti.com/product/TMS320F2808) Digital Signal Processors.
